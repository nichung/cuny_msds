# 1. question 
##### The goal of this assignment is to give you practice in preparing different datasets for downstream analysis work.
##### Your task is to:
##### (1) Choose any three of the “wide” datasets identified in the Week 6 Discussion items. (You may use your own dataset; please don’t use my Sample Post dataset, since that was used in your Week 6 assignment!) For each of the three chosen datasets:
##### * Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information included in the dataset. You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears in the discussion item, so that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
##### * Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data. [Most of your grade will be based on this step!]
##### * Perform the analysis requested in the discussion item.
##### * Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions.
##### (2) Please include in your homework submission, for each of the three chosen datasets:
##### * The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository, and
##### * The URL for your rpubs.com web page.
